# Elm Introduction: TODO list

Example of a simple TODO list that uses a server to save and load TODOs. It demonstrates how the Elm architecture works and how to use [elm/http](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/) and [elm/json](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/) packages.

You need to install server dependencies using yarn:

```
$ yarn
```

Then, you can start the server:

```
$ yarn server
```

And the Elm app using elm reactor - run script:

```
$ yarn dev
```

Format `js` and `ELM` code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format):

```
$ yarn format
```
